      <h1 class="heading">Mission</h1>
      With a lack of Alliance guilds that value both efficient endgame
      progression, and a respectful tight-knit atmosphere, Dexterity was
      created. With fewer guilds choosing to focus on the holistic attributes of
      raiding, and players vocal dissatisfaction of the games trend in recent
      years, Dexterity will be a fresh opportunity for some, and for others it
      will be a community they've been searching for.

      <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>
      Dexterity is a guild that aims to be one of the most competitive raiding
      guilds on a light schedule, all while fostering an inclusive and
      supportive community of people who are excited to login everyday and enjoy
      playing with each other. Our leadership team has had very successful
      raiding careers from a rankings perspective consistently competing in "top
      50 US" guilds and higher most recently as BFA-Nathria, but from a
      community and guild longevity standpoint has been something we've been
      searching for throughout the years, and are fully committed to make the
      most of our raid week while maintaining an atmosphere that few guilds have
      proven to offer. While we are a new guild make no mistake, we are a
      progression oriented guild and understand the dedication that is required
      to constantly improve every tier. That being said, we have clear goals and
      expectations of all of our members. Our players always look through logs,
      improve each other's play, and help with strategy. We require each player
      to not only understand but contribute and find every other piece of
      information available to them to be prepared for the fights. We will not
      compromise the raid by trialing those who are skilled at their class, but
      don't put in the effort outside of that. Everyone is expected to pull more
      than their own weight here.

      This is a strict 9-hour per week schedule. We do not add extra time or
      days, and all of our raid activity is publicly logged. We also do not run
      split groups and thus do not require an alt.

      <h1 class="heading">What We Can Offer</h1>
      A raiding atmosphere like none other where your enthusiasm and passion to
      be at the top is shared by everyone and a chance to build a foundation in
      our guild, allowing you to experience new content with some of the most
      talented and dedicated individuals playing this game. Dexterity is unique
      amidst a sea of poorly managed guilds that lack focus, cohesiveness, and
      integrity. If you're looking for a new home where you can grow and feel
      valued as part of a team with a reliable schedule: we want to hear from
      you.

      <h1 class="heading">Attendance</h1>
      The best ability is availability. We do not recruit for bench positions,
      we expect all raiders to be able to maintain as close to 100% attendance
      as possible during progression. That being said, we understand real life
      happens and expect our raiders to call out as far in advance as possible.
